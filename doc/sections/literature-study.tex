\section{Literature Study}

    This section forms the main body of the thesis, providing a detailed explanation of the content of the related paper. Although much of the material is based on the paper, this section is included to offer a clear breakdown of the research work.\tinydouble

    The first section introduces the key concepts of \emph{Game Theory}, mainly focusing on dynamic games. The second section presents the \emph{Graph Coloring Game}, which forms the basis for analysis. Here, we explain the game's state and action spaces, as well as its reward system. In the third section, we present the \emph{$\alpha$-Rank}, the core evolutionary approach behind the proposed methodology. This section provides a more detailed definition of \emph{Markov-Conley Chains} and explains how they model strategy evolution. Section four defines the problem we aim to solve and outlines the proposed methodology. Section five applies this methodology to the \emph{Graph Coloring Game}, demonstrating its practical implementation. This section is further divided into subsections that break down the methodology into clear steps. Finally, the conclusion summarizes our findings and suggests potential directions for future work.
