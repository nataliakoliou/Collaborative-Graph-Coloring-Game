    The first section introduces the key concepts of \emph{Game Theory}, mainly focusing on dynamic games. The second section presents \emph{$\alpha$-Rank}, the core evolutionary method behind the proposed methodology. This section provides a detailed definition of \emph{Markov-Conley Chains} and explains how they model strategy evolution. The third section defines the problem we aim to solve and outlines the proposed methodology. The fourth section introduces the \emph{Graph Coloring Game}, which is used to demonstrate the proposed methodology. Here, we explain the game's state and action spaces, as well as its reward function. The fifth section applies the proposed methodology to the \emph{Graph Coloring Game}, demonstrating its practical implementation. Finally, the conclusion summarizes our findings and suggests potential directions for future work.
